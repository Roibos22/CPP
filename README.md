# CPP

This series of modules is designed to progressively build a solid foundation in modern C++ development.

**Module 00**

Introduction to C++ - Start with the basics of C++ syntax, structure, and the compilation process. Learn about streams, basic I/O, and the concept of namespace.

**Module 01**

Memory Allocation, References, Pointers - This module dives into dynamic memory management, pointers, and references, which are crucial for efficient C++ programming.

**Module 02**

Ad-hoc Polymorphism, operators overload - Explore the concepts of operator overloading and ad-hoc polymorphism, which allow for custom behavior of operators for user-defined types.

**Module 03**

Inheritance - The focus shifts to class hierarchies and inheritance, enabling to design extensible systems using base and derived classes.

**Module 04**

Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces - This module covers the use of virtual functions, abstract classes, and interfaces to implement polymorphic behavior.

**Module 05**

Try/Catch - Exception Handling, Nested Classes - Learn to manage exceptions using try/catch blocks, and they delve into the utility of nested classes.

**Module 06**

C++ Casts - The module introduces static, dynamic, const, and reinterpret casts, teaching the importance of type conversion in C++.

**Module 07**

Templates - C++ templates are introduced to provide the ability to write generic and reusable code.

**Module 08**

STL - The Standard Template Library (STL) is covered, allowing to use a collection of powerful data structures and algorithms.

**Module 09**

Namespace, Exceptions, IOStreams - The module wraps up with a deeper look into the C++ tools for handling namespaces, managing exceptions, and working with input/output streams.
